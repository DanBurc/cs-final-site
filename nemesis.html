        <figcaption>The army/nemesis screen of a region in Shadow of War</figcaption>
        
        <h1>Nemeses</h1>
        <p>The nemesis system starts with the army screen, which is unique in each region. This is comprised of Orcs, Uruks, and Olog-Hair that have gained recognition through some means in the orc heighrarchy. Each enemy has a unique generated personality and voice, and will interact with other Orcs, in power struggles for more power or respect from other orcs.</p>
        
        <h1>Recruiting and Forts</h1>
        <p>Later in the game, you are given the ability to recruit orc captains and also lower grunts. When you recruit the higher orc captains, their subbordinates are added to your army as well, quickly increasing your strength and enabling you to eventually take on the fortress of that region. Doing this will give you control over the region, and allow you to put in place you rown overlord and warchiefs to govern the region. The type of orc and their personality will change different things in the region, such as the look and how many animals are there.</p>
   
        <h1>Names and Titles</h1>
        <p>Each Nemesis has a unique name and title, typically representative of their overall characterization. </p>
  
        <h1>Visuals</h1>
        <p>Nemeses are generated uniquely from a large pool of multiple body types, parts, hairstyles, behaviors, voices, animations, etc. The appearance of a Nemesis can usually indicate their type of personality. This customization expands in scope every time these Uruk advance up the ranks of the Army. When an Uruk becomes a Captain, he gains more fearsome weapons and armor as befitting his personality. This is further enhanced when the Captain manages to become a Warchief or Overlord, where he will wear even more imposing armor to befit his new status.</p>
  
        <h1>Relationships</h1>
        <p>Some Nemeses may develop a relationship with other Nemeses. This usually involves a rivalry between the two Uruks, and Talion will always find these two doing missions against each other until one of them dies. If a Captain proves himself worthy, he can serve as the Bodyguard to a Warchief. An Overlord can have a Bodyguard even though he has control over the entire region. When a Warchief confronts Talion, all his Bodyguards will be present at his side. The Bodyguards of Warchiefs can be encountered alone, away from their master. In Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Uruks and Ologs can become blood-brothers with another Nemesis, meaning that the two share a positive relationship. If Talion kills one of them, the other will seek revenge.</p>
  
        <h1>Power Levels</h1>
        <p>It is power and strength that defines Uruk society; those with more power reign over those without. The higher an Uruk's Power Level, the more powerful he will be in battle. In terms of a Nemesis' acquired Traits, a low Power Level will guarantee more Weaknesses and fewer Strengths while a high Power Level will guarantee fewer Weaknesses and more Strengths. A Nemesis' list of Traits will change (generally losing Weaknesses and gaining Strengths) as his Power Level increases. A Power Level also affects their general toughness and damage-dealing ability. The maximum Power Level, for both Captains and Warchiefs, is 20 in Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and 25 in The Bright Lord DLC. The maximum Power Level for all Nemeses, including Captains, Warchiefs, and Overlords, in Shadow of War is 85.</p>
