    <h1>Blade of Galadriel</h1>
    <p>The Blade of Galadriel Expansion is based around one of the side characters in the main campaign, and is lead by the Elf "Eltariel". It revolves around the events after the main story of the game ends and Talion is keeping Mordor in a perpetual state of war. Eltariel assists Talion in defending and taking fortresses as well as going on her own adventures. The combat is much the same, but has a range of new abilities.</p>

    <h1>The Desolation of Mordor</h1>
    <p>The Desolation of Mordor expansion is lead by another side character in the original game, Baranor. Baranor is sent to destroy a fortress in a region called Lithlad, a region unnaccessible in the main game unless this expansion is purchased. Both the combat and movement abilities in this expansion are very different from the other 2 story modes, including a retractable shield and a wrist mounted crossbow type device. This expansion is enjoyable, but was heavily critisized because of one of its core mechanics, that when you die, all your progress is lost and you receive a "high score" which many players found made the story meaningless and their progress a waste of time.</p>


    <h1>Tribe Expansions</h1>
    <p>There were also two expansions that were not related to the story, but added more variety to the Uruks in the main game, introducing two new tribes which meant more personalities and such. The names of the two tribes were the Slaughter Tribe and the Outlaw tribe.</p>
